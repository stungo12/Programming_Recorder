# Programming Recorder

## Overview
Programming Recorder was created because I wanted a way to record how much time I was spending each day on programming. This could have been accomplished using a spreadsheet or typing in a text editor, but I wanted to create
my own program to accomplish this task. Some of my requirements for the program were to use a SQL database to store the entries so that they could be retrieved later, I wanted to complete the program within a week, and I
wanted to use GitHub as a repository and to allow others to look at it and use it if they wanted to. The current state of the program is that it is functional, it does what I want it to do, but it still could use work to make
it more useful and look more appealing.

## How to Download
You can either download the ZIP file or clone the repository. You will also need Python installed on your device to be able to run the program. Other than that, the libraries that are used should be included with Python so
you shouldn't need to download anything else. Have fun and enjoy.

## What Needs to Be Done
Here is a list of things that I would like to add to improve this project:
* A graphical interface to be able to make it look more appealing and more intuitive
* Add an Edit function. There's a menu option for it, but it currently doesn't work as it wasn't necessary and would have taken more time and thought then what I wanted to put in for the time being
* Graphs and charts to make the information more understandable. I wanted a way to measure how much time I'm spending on programming over a period of time and get a better idea on why I might be slacking
* Create a function to automatically add in the Recorder_ID
Please feel free to let me know if there are any other functionalities that you think should be added or work on one of the to-dos above
